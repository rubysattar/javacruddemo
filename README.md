# Intro
This is a test application to practice my skills, using Java and its associated tools to CRUD on a single resource. The end goal is for this to be part of an application that manages "teacher to-do's". Future iterations will include a relationship in MySql to outline one-teacher-to-many-tasks.

## My planning process

## User Stories
- Users will be able to create teaching tasks
- Users will be able to read teaching tasks (index and show)
- Users will be able to update teaching tasks
